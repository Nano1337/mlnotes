### Adv ML: 
- Add most recent class notes on convexity and Lipshitz continuity 

### RL:
- exploitation vs exploration: 
	- exploration: random search of initial states for more options
	- exploitation: 
		- maximize reward
		- This is not necessarily greedy bc the maximal reward taken at a state is an accumulation of all future states so greedy nature is sidestepped
- Review class notes from first lecture
