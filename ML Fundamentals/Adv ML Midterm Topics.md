### Gradient Descent: 
- Batch/Stochastic GD
- How SGD is impacted by: 
	- Initialization 
	- Step Size 
	- Loss: convex, nonconvex, Lipshitz continuity
- How to measure performance of GD: (expected optimality gap)
- no questions on momentum NTK

### Variance Reduction in Gradient Descent
- What problem is variance reduction solving
- Impact of batching
- Know variance reduction methods: 
	- SVRG
	- SAG
	- SAGA

### Fundamentals of Bayesian Inference
- Steps of inference: specify (likelihood, prior) -> derive posterior, marginal likelihood, posterior predictive distribution
- Point Estimates (MLE, MAP): how does a prediction made with point estimate compare with the posterior predictive distribution?
- Conjugate Priors
- Beta-binomial model: how do we understand posterior as function of likelihood/prior
